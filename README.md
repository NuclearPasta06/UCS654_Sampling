Comparing Sampling Techniques
This project compares different sampling techniques for creating a balanced dataset for a machine learning model. The dataset used is initially unbalanced, so appropriate over-sampling techniques are used to create a balanced dataset. Five different sampling techniques are then applied to the balanced dataset, and each sample is trained with about 15 different ML models (classification) using pycaret and their accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are compared.
After then the most Adequate Models are selected and then compared.
# Results
Stratified sampling gave highest accuracy with Ada(Ada Boost Classifier).
